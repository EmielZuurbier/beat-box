# beat-box
A Beat Box project created with the Web Audio API.
This project was based on an assignement for my class. I have completely rewritten the Javascript for a more cohesive and understandable system.

## Support
Currently it works on Chrome desktop and mobile.
Firefox and Safari will come soone.

## Customize
You can put your own sounds in easily.

### Step one
Just put your sound files in the sounds folder.
### Step two
Change the `href` attribute of the links in the html.
The scripts will take those paths and take them through the AudioContext constructor.
*Now you've got your custom sounds*
